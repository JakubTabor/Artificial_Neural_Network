# My "X" will be my "df" from 4 columns to columns "EstimatedSalary" almoust last, because last column will be my "y", so column "Exited"
# Now I need to encode my columns "Geography and Gender", so I import "LabelEncoder" and put into my 3 firs columns from my new "df"
# And I use "fit_transform method" on them "X[:,2] = le.fit_transform(X[:,2])"
